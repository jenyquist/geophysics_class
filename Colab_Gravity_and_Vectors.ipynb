Along the axis of the bolt, which is perpendicular to F and r.  Yes, but up or down?  Well that depends on whether you are tightening or loosening the bolt.  This is where the right-hand rule business comes in.  The point is that vector multiplication doesn't commute.  The order of multiplication is important.  In fact, a x b = - b x a.  One direction you tighten the bolt, the other you loosen.\n",
